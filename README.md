# Star_Wars_Shows_Ranked



In my project, I will create a website for ranking the Star Wars TV shows that have been released. 
In my project there will be a home page with multiple actions. There will be a Sign Up button that will redirect the user 
to a login and registration webpage. Here, the user can create an account using their name, email, and password. 
Once they have created an account, the user will be redirected back to the homepage. On the homepage, there will be a 
list of all the shows that are available. Each show will be linked so that the user can click on the name of the show 
and it will redirect them to a new webpage about that specific show. On the specific show webpage will be a header with 
the user's name, the show's title, and the show's description along with ratings. If the user is interested in the show, 
they can click on the "Add" button. This button will add shows that the user has selected into a nice and orderly webpage 
designed for the user. This will allow the user to only select shows that they are interested in.
